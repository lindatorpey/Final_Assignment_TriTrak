# Final_Assignment_TriTrak
This Assignment was completed for continious assessment for Mobile App Development 2 module of Creative Computing course (Year 4) at SETU
The app consists is designed for triathletes to log their training times. 
It consists of a log page where the user can choose between three different excercise options.
There is also a list page which lists all excercises logs.
Finally there is a simple about page.
Users can create accounts(register) and log in using Firebase email authentication method. 
Navigation is achieved by a normal options menu as well as a nav drawer.
All views are contained in fragments. 
A local database was used to store excercises and apply CRUD functionality.

Part of the requirements for this assignment was to use and existing Git repository, however I was unable to do this as I had issues authenticating pushes with Git
Every time I attempted to push a commit I received a "bad credentials error" so I had to create a new repository for the app. 

I found this assignment, and module, very difficult. The learning curve was very steep and the smallest errors could take hours to rectify.
However I do feel that I learned a lot and even though this app is simple I am proud of it and the work that went into it.

I received general android tuition and help with the local database from Muhammad Faisal, who I contacted through fiverr.
